# aspnet-mvc-app

jScore is a ASP.NET MVC5 application which presents data about sports clubs, stadiums, footballers and played matches. For the administrator role, it provides all CRUD functions.

For this project I used:

* ASP.NET MVC5
* Entity Framework
* LINQ to SQL
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
